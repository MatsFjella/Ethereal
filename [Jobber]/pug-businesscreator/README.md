# ------------------------------
# Installation
- Run the pug-businesscreator.sql before doing anything else.
- Read through the config.lua & open.lua thoroughly and adjust everything to match your server. (VERY IMPORTANT)
# ------------------------------


# ------------------------------
# HELPFUL NOTES.
1. Do /business in game to open the menu.
2. Do /createditems in game to view and remove any created item.
3. To remove the red or green box outlines turn Config.Debug to false. They are all on by default to help visually see what is happening.
4. If you test the registers make sure your job is the job the register is set too or else it will not create the customers register.
5. If you want to make criminal crafting benches are targets that ANYONE can target then make a business called "criminal" in the menu and make the crafting bench/targets under that job.
6. If you are QBCORE you need to have the business name in your qb-core/shared/jobs.lua for it to work in the menu of the script.
7. If you are ESX you need to have the business name in your database under jobs and job_grades. You will need to know the basics of your server to do this. I am not to be depended on to do basic server things for your server. 
8. If you are ESX you need to restart your server after making a business in the business creator menu for the money from the register sales to go into the businesses society fund.
